# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems that I am practicing.
It includes problems from popular platforms like **LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Codeforces**.

## 📂 Structure

* Each topic will have its own folder:

  * `Arrays/`
  * `Strings/`
  * `LinkedList/`
  * `StackQueue/`
  * `Recursion/`
  * `Trees/`
  * `Graphs/`
  * `DynamicProgramming/`
* Each file will be named after the problem for easy reference.

## 🛠 Languages Used

* **Java** (primary)
* May add C++/Python solutions later.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Strengthen problem-solving skills.
* Prepare for coding interviews at top tech companies.
* Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

Would you like me to:

* Make it **more attractive (with badges, emojis, colors)** for GitHub?
* Or keep it **minimal and professional**?
* Or make **two versions (simple and attractive)**?
